## Current Vacancies

**Ecommerce Developer - Magento / Shopify**

Full time 40 hours per week, Monday - Friday.

This is an opportunity for an experienced PHP developer to strike the perfect balance between working for a client and an agency. Your time will be shared across 3-4 long term business relationships, working within the ecommerce team of Green Snow. You will see the full impact of your work, and will be able to work on projects for the long term, while still varying your workload between some very different projects. 

There will be continued development of new Magento 2 sites. Delivering a road map of user experience and operational enhancements to the Magento System. This includes configuring and customising extensions and creating custom code. Acting as technical lead for the project and assisting the ecommerce team on the optimisation of the project.    You will also be involved in a migration from M1 to M2, liaising with our off-shore development team where appropriate.

In addition there will be development and optimisation of our Shopify sites, testing, learning and optimising, ensuring we use our insight appropriately to roll out improvements across the various sites to suit each client and audience.

You will have gained experience working with Magento and Shopify, either during your previous job, a work placement or in your own time. You will be comfortable building and maintaining a site on your own, and comfortable making decisions and installing your own working practices. At the same time, there will be support from a team very comfortable working with both platforms and very comfortable ensuring developers are well supported and given the time and resources to develop their own knowledge. 

The right candidate will also act as technical lead across other business projects, whether it is configuring our order management system (XML script) or new business intelligent tools that look to unify and optmise our internal working practices.   Experience working and integrating multiple business systems will be very useful experience.
