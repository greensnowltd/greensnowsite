We exist to create the ultimate fan-focused online retail environments for brands to thrive in. We work hard on behalf of our brand partners to convert their followers into high value customers and we do it in a way that minimises our impact on the planet.

We’re a principled lot at Green Snow with strong values. That’s what separates us from the crowd. We have **4 core values** that hold true across everything we do, every single day.

### **Do the right thing**

• Your customer is the centre of our universe.

• We take our role seriously because we know getting the online retail experience wrong can damage your brand forever.

• We go the extra mile to ensure the experience your fans have in your online store deepens their love for your brand.

• We will never work with brands that don’t share our own high standards and product expectations.

• We live and breathe the brands we represent.

• We lead by example and reduce the environmental impact in all that we do.

### **Be true to your roots**

• We make your online retail an extension of your brand values.

• We take time to get under the skin of your fans and curate a retail experience that is tailored to their passions.

• We plug into our partners’ brand vision and values to develop authentic, believable and valued alignment to your proposition.

• We keep a close watch on the market to help you understand what your audiences need from your retail arm.

• We believe in the brands we work with and represent them through every tiny touch point that they have with their customers.

### **Leave a small footprint**

• We are environmentally aware, passionately anti-plastic and actively engaged.

• We will adopt environmentally friendly packaging for our own products and work hard to influence the supply chain from within.

• We will proactively encourage all manufacturers we work with to follow our lead, and commit to clean and sustainable growth.

• We encourage our staff to enjoy a healthy and sustainable lifestyle that leaves the planet in a better and more stable condition for future generations.

• We believe that it is our duty to conduct every element of our business in a way that has a positive impact on society and does not damage the environment.

### **Keep it personal**

• We always treat customers the way we want to be treated ourselves.

• We would rather act like David than Goliath, even when working with the biggest brands.

• We have an eye for detail, we act with agility and we always work hard to deliver quality retail experiences.

• We create nurturing online retail journeys, which are built around your customers to ensure they feel cared for through the whole process.

• Our aim is to be a seamless part of our clients’ team; valued partners who are working towards a common goal.
