### Do the right thing

In the past year as a brand and company we have become more aware about our effect on the environment. We want to lead by example and minimise our impact we have on the planet! 

WE EQUIP YOUR TRIBE with our bio-degradable plastic! We avoid plastics altogether where we can, but we are making sure that we are only using bio-plastic when we really need to. With reducing the plastic in just our workroom, in 1 year alone we will be able to save over 26,000 single-use plastic bags. We are taking this approach across the business, finding creative solutions to have a positive impact on our planet across everything we do.

When your fans and customers receive an order despatched by Green Snow the impact is strong. From the paper bag, cardboard box or bio-degradable bag, to the kraft recycled postcard carrying your message, and the distinct lack of any single-use plastic inside, it makes people stop, think and appreciate what they've received.

We are constantly improving and evolving what we we do, and while we have full control of our own products, we are constantly pushing our external suppliers to improve. This is a marathon, but we are setting PB's every day and will continue to do so.

The environmental issues are at the heart of the company and feed through to the daily decisions we make. Whether it is the use of bio soap in the bathroom, sending orders with paper packing tape or simply turning the lights off when we've finished in the meeting room, we question everything we do and make sure we do the right thing for us, our partners, and our planet.
